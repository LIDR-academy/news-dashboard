# News Filters Feature - Acceptance Criteria

## Feature: News Content Filtering System
**User Story:** As a news manager, I want to filter my news articles by category and favorites so that I can quickly find specific content and organize my reading workflow efficiently.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

### 1. Category Filter Functionality
**Given** I am on the news dashboard with multiple news items across different categories  
**When** I click on the Category dropdown button  
**Then** I should see a dropdown menu with the following options:
- "All Categories" (default selection)
- "General" 
- "Research"
- "Product" 
- "Company"
- "Tutorial"
- "Opinion"

**Given** I select a specific category from the dropdown  
**When** the filter is applied  
**Then** 
- Only news items with that category should be visible in all columns
- The Category button should display a badge with the selected category name
- The news count in each column should update to reflect filtered results
- The total statistics should update to show filtered counts

### 2. Favorites Filter Functionality
**Given** I have news items where some are marked as favorites  
**When** I toggle the "Favorites only" switch to ON  
**Then**
- Only news items marked as favorites should be visible
- The switch should show active/checked state
- News counts should update to reflect only favorite items
- All three columns (To Read, Reading, Completed) should update simultaneously

**Given** the favorites filter is active  
**When** I toggle the "Favorites only" switch to OFF  
**Then** 
- All news items should become visible again
- The switch should show inactive/unchecked state
- Full news counts should be restored

### 3. Combined Filters Functionality
**Given** I have both category and favorites filters available  
**When** I select a specific category AND enable favorites filter  
**Then**
- Only news items that match BOTH criteria should be visible
- Both the category badge and favorites switch should show active states
- News counts should reflect the combined filtering
- The "Clear filters" button should appear

### 4. Clear Filters Functionality
**Given** I have one or more active filters applied  
**When** the filters are active  
**Then** a "Clear filters" button with an X icon should be visible

**Given** active filters are applied  
**When** I click the "Clear filters" button  
**Then**
- All filters should be reset to default state
- Category should reset to "All Categories" 
- Favorites switch should be turned OFF
- All news items should become visible
- The "Clear filters" button should disappear
- Statistics should show full counts

### 5. Filter State Persistence
**Given** I have applied filters to my news view  
**When** I perform other actions like:
- Adding a new news item
- Changing news status (moving between columns)
- Marking/unmarking favorites
- Refreshing the page  
**Then** the applied filters should remain active and continue filtering the updated results

### 6. Real-time Filter Updates
**Given** I have filters applied  
**When** news data changes (new items added, status updated, favorites toggled)  
**Then** 
- The filtered view should update immediately
- News counts should update to reflect current filtered state
- No manual refresh should be required

## Edge Cases

### Empty Results Scenario
**Scenario:** Filter combination returns no results  
**Expected behavior:** 
- Empty columns should be displayed
- All statistics should show "0"
- Filter controls should remain active and functional
- Clear message indicating no results match current filters

### Single Item Scenario  
**Scenario:** Only one news item exists  
**Expected behavior:**
- Filters should work correctly with single item
- Item should appear/disappear based on filter criteria
- Statistics should accurately reflect 0 or 1

### All Items Filtered Out
**Scenario:** All items are filtered out by current criteria
**Expected behavior:**
- Kanban board should show empty columns
- Statistics should show all zeros
- Filter controls should remain accessible
- User can still clear filters or modify criteria

### Category Change While Favorites Active
**Scenario:** Change category while favorites filter is enabled
**Expected behavior:**
- Both filters should apply simultaneously
- Results should show only items matching both criteria
- Both filter indicators should remain active
