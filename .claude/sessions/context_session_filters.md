# Context Session: News Filters Feature

## Project Overview
This is a React FastAPI boilerplate project with a News Management system implementing a Kanban-style board for organizing news articles by reading status.

## Current Feature Context

### News Filters Component
The news filtering system is implemented in `NewsFilters.tsx` with the following capabilities:

**Available Filters:**
1. **Category Filter** - Dropdown menu with 6 categories:
   - General
   - Research  
   - Product
   - Company
   - Tutorial
   - Opinion

2. **Favorites Filter** - Toggle switch to show only favorited news items

3. **Clear Filters** - Button to reset all active filters

### Technical Implementation

**Data Schema (`news.schema.ts`):**
- `NewsFilters` interface supports multiple filter types including status, category, is_favorite, date ranges, and pagination
- `NewsCategory` enum defines 6 available categories
- `NewsStatus` enum defines 3 status levels (pending, reading, read)

**Context Integration (`useNewsContext.tsx`):**
- Filters are managed via React context state
- `setFilters` function updates the filter state
- News data is automatically refetched when filters change
- News items are grouped by status for Kanban display

**User Interface:**
- Filter controls located above the Kanban board
- Category dropdown shows badge with current selection
- Favorites toggle switch with label
- Clear filters button appears only when filters are active
- Responsive design with mobile-friendly controls

## Current Testing Status
The filtering functionality is currently implemented and deployed. This validation session will test all filter scenarios comprehensively using Playwright automation.

## Key User Flows to Validate
1. Category filtering across all 6 categories
2. Favorites-only filtering
3. Combined filters (category + favorites)
4. Filter clearing
5. Filter persistence during other actions
6. Mobile responsiveness
7. Accessibility compliance

## Success Criteria
- All filter types work correctly
- News items update immediately when filters change
- Visual feedback shows active filters clearly
- Filter state persists during other operations
- Mobile interface remains functional
- Accessibility standards are met
