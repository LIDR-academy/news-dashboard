After developing anything new, review all the changes and update the proper docs (for instance, if there are changes in the data models, update the section data model definition in the PRD.md file) All docs in English

### Documentation Updates
When updating documentation, I will:
1. Review all recent changes in the codebase
2. Identify which documentation files need updates based on the changes:
   - For data model changes: Update data model definition section in datamodel.md
   - For API changes: Update api-docs.yml
3. Update each affected documentation file in English, maintaining consistency with existing documentation
4. Ensure all documentation is properly formatted and follows the established structure
5. Verify that all changes are accurately reflected in the documentation
6. Report which files were updated and what changes were made
