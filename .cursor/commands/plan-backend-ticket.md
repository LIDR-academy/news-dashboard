$ARGUMENTS

# Goal

Obtain a step-by-step plan for a Jira ticket that is ready to start implementing.

# Process and rules

1. Analyze the Jira ticket mentioned in #ticket using the MCP.
2. Propose a step-by-step plan for the backend part, taking into account everything mentioned in the ticket and applying the project’s best practices and rules.
3. Apply the best practices of your role to ensure the developer can be fully autonomous and implement the ticket end-to-end using only your plan.
4. Do not write code yet; provide only the plan in the output format defined below.
5. If you are asked to start implementing at some point, make sure the first thing you do is to move to a branch named after the ticket id (if you are not yet there)

# Output format

Markdown document at the path `tasks/[jira_id].md` containing the complete implementation details.
